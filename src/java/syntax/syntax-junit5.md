Now, let's take a closer look at each of the Qase functions.


### Qase ID
---
To associate a test case in Qase with a test, use the @QaseId annotation. This helps link your automated test results to Qase test cases.
```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/QaseIdTest.java:syntax}}
```

### Qase Title
--- 

To set a title for a test case in Qase, use the @QaseTitle tag. This title will either create a new test case with the given title or update an existing case title.

```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/TitleTest.java:syntax}}
```

If the title is not explicitly set, the scenario title from .feature file will be used.

To update a Qase test case's title from code, you must enable "[Update test cases](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/5563702-test-runs#h_161810cf24)" in your project's run settings.




### Suite
---

You can group your test cases under a specific Suite using the `QaseSuite` tag in your feature file.

```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/SuiteTest.java:syntax}}
```
This helps you organize your test cases in Qase under relevant suites.

### Steps
---

You can describe individual test steps using the @Step annotation. These steps will be shown in your Qase test run results, helping reviewers understand what actions were taken and where a failure might have occurred. This improves both readability and traceability of your tests inside Qase.
```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/StepsTest.java:syntax}}
```
Each method annotated with @Step becomes a clearly defined step in the test run results, making it easier to follow the test flow and pinpoint issues.

### Params
---
To run the same test method with multiple sets of input data, use the @ParameterizedTest annotation. This is helpful when validating a test against various inputs without writing separate methods for each. 

```java
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
```
### Fields
---
Currently, you can define `description`, `pre & post conditions`, and fields like `severity`, `priority`, `layer` with this method, allowing you to specify and maintain the context of the case, all directly from within your feature file. 

```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/FieldsTest.java:syntax}}
```

### Ignore
---
If this tag is added, the reporter will exclude the testâ€™s result from the report sent to Qase. While the test will still executed, its result will not be considered by the reporter.

```java
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
```

### Attach
---
You can attach one or more files to a test result using the Qase.attach() method. This is useful when you want to include evidence like screenshots, logs, or text files with your test execution results in Qase.

```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/AttachTest.java:syntax}}
```

### Comment

Use Qase.comment() to add meaningful commentary to the test result. This is especially helpful for describing actual outcomes, adding debug info, or clarifying why a result may differ from expectations.

```java
{{#include ../code/junit5/CommentTest.java:syntax}}
```
