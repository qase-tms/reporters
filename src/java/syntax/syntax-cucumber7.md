Now, let's take a closer look at each of the Qase functions.


### Qase ID
---
To associate a Test Case ID with test results, use the '@QaseId' tag in your .feature file

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/QaseId.feature:syntax}}
```

### Qase Title
--- 

To set a title for a test case in Qase, use the @QaseTitle tag. This title will either create a new test case with the given title or update an existing case title.

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/Title.feature:syntax}}
```

To update a Qase test case's title from code, you must enable "[Update test cases](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/5563702-test-runs#h_161810cf24)" in your project's run settings.

If the title is not explicitly set, the scenario title from .feature file will be used.


### Suite
---

You can group your test cases under a specific Suite using the `QaseSuite` tag in your feature file.

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/Suite.feature:syntax}}
```
This helps you organize your test cases in Qase under relevant suites.


### Fields
---
Currently, you can define `description`, `pre & post conditions`, and fields like `severity`, `priority`, `layer` with this method, allowing you to specify and maintain the context of the case, all directly from within your feature file. 

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/Fields.feature:syntax}}
```

### Ignore
---
If this tag is added, the reporter will exclude the testâ€™s result from the report sent to Qase. While the test will still executed, its result will not be considered by the reporter.

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/Ignore.feature:syntax}}
```

### Attach
---
The attach logic is implemented in java file located at [**Stepdefinition**](https://github.com/cskmnrpt/qase-cucumber/tree/cucumber7/src/test/java/com/example/stepdefinitions) directory, not directly inside the .feature file.
The feature file only contains the scenario steps, while the actual attachment is handled programmatically in the Java step definitions.

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/Attach.feature:syntax}}
```

### Comment
The comment logic is added in java file located at [**Stepdefinition**](https://github.com/cskmnrpt/qase-cucumber/tree/cucumber7/src/test/java/com/example/stepdefinitions) directory.
The .feature file only contains the scenario flow, while the comment is programmatically set inside step definitions.

```feature
{{#include ../code/cucumber7/features/comment.feature:syntax}}
```
