# Behave

Behave is a Python-based behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework. It allows writing tests in a natural language style using the Gherkin syntax, making collaboration between technical and non-technical team members easier. Behave is commonly used for end-to-end, integration, and functional testing, following the Given-When-Then format.

With `qase-behave`, you can seamlessly publish the results of your automated BDD test runs to your Qase project using the public API
